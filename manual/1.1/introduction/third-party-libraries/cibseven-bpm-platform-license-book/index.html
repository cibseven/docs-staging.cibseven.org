<hr>
<h2 id="sil-open-font-license-version-11---26-february-2007">SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</h2>
<p>PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.</p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS
&ldquo;Font Software&rdquo; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reserved Font Name&rdquo; refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Original Version&rdquo; refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Author&rdquo; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
<p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining

redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol>

redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as

permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,

distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.</p>

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.</p>

<p>This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">http://scripts.sil.org/OFL</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sil-open-font-license-version-11---26-february-2007-1">SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</h2>
<p>PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.</p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS
&ldquo;Font Software&rdquo; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reserved Font Name&rdquo; refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Original Version&rdquo; refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting &ndash; in part or in whole &ndash; any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Author&rdquo; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
<p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

<p>This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">http://scripts.sil.org/OFL</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sil-open-font-license-version-11---26-february-2007-2">SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</h2>
<p>PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.</p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS
&ldquo;Font Software&rdquo; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reserved Font Name&rdquo; refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Original Version&rdquo; refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting &ndash; in part or in whole &ndash; any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Author&rdquo; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
<p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.</p>

<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

<li>License Grants and Conditions</li>
</ol>
<p>2.1. Grants</p>
<p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
or its Contributor Version.</p>
<p>2.2. Effective Date</p>

effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
such Contribution.</p>
<p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>
<p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</p>
<p>a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</p>
<p>b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
Version); or</p>
<p>c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
Contributions.</p>
<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
(see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>
<p>2.5. Representation</p>
<p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>2.6. Fair Use</p>
<p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.</p>
<p>2.7. Conditions</p>
<p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
Section 2.1.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Responsibilities</li>
</ol>
<p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.</p>
<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
<p>a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
<p>b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>
<p>3.4. Notices</p>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</li>
</ol>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Termination</li>
</ol>
<p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
shall terminate.</p>
<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
termination shall survive termination.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Disclaimer of Warranty</li>
</ol>
<p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
except under this disclaimer.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Limitation of Liability</li>
</ol>
<p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Litigation</li>
</ol>
<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Miscellaneous</li>
</ol>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Versions of the License</li>
</ol>
<p>10.1. New Versions</p>
<p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.</p>
<p>10.2. Effect of New Versions</p>
<p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.</p>
<p>10.3. Modified Versions</p>
<p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
modified license differs from this License).</p>
<p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>

Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright owner as &ldquo;Not a Contribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contributor&rdquo; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &ldquo;NOTICE&rdquo; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>&mdash; Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License &mdash;-</p>
<p>As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions
of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you
may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying
with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.</p>
<p>In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with
software that is licensed under the GPLv2 (&ldquo;Combined Software&rdquo;) and if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section
3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License
conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and
prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of
the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined
Software.
